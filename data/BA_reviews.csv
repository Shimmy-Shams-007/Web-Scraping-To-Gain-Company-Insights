0,✅ Trip Verified |  Good lounge at Cape Town. On time departure. Drinks high quality. Sound dinner service. Breakfast reasonable. Arrival lounge was good but showers cold.
1,"✅ Trip Verified |  A really excellent journey. Lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon, plenty of edible food. Easy boarding. New Club World Suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards- choice of individual wines rather than bland blends, courses served individually with cut glass and china. Beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup. Crew excellent. Good choice of movies. Breakfast after a good night's sleep- fruits etc first, couldn't manage the full English which was offered. Arrival on time. What more could you want? Not quite up to Gulf standards overall, but BA seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard"
2,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price. "
3,"Not Verified | It seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines. I cannot even check in because BA requires the submission of documents for Covid restrictions. However the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken. After clicking ""submit"" the form just hangs forever. No error message is given. I tried three different browsers on three different devices. All have the same hang. Which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat. I tried using the chat bot, but after 30 minutes of clicking ""try again"" I thought I had donated enough time to BA. "
4,"Not Verified |  As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago)."
5,"✅ Trip Verified |  A rather empty and quiet flight to Tel Aviv, very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight I had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required. Unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us. Otherwise an overall excellent flight on BA's part. This was the first time I have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time."
6,✅ Trip Verified |  Easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to BA. Security at London was fast. Galleries North was fine and showers were good. Organised flight boarding. Plane was fine with good crew and new club world product. My wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok. After take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run. Slept well on time arrival. We both found the new seat design harder to sleep in.
7,"✅ Trip Verified |  Being a silver flyer and booking a flight through BA to Dublin you would have thought I could use the lounge even though BA used Air Lingus for the flight. Travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind Gentleman at the desk even though he said I had to be Gold ? He was really accommodating and it wasn’t a big deal. But the two ladies on the desk were like no. No empathy there at all-saying the other guy shouldn’t have let me and they will have a word with him ? Come on BA I booked the flight through you, and you made me fly with Air Lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier. "
8,"Not Verified |  I find BA incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers. I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones. BA I now realise stands for Budget Airline. Staff were great - what you got for your money not so much."
9,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible. This flight was so disappointing. Other than one great member of cabin crew, everything else was just average."
10,"Not Verified |  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.
"
11,"Not Verified | The staff are friendly. The plane was cold, we were shivering, they gave light blankets but they were not enough. Meals were basic. Entertainment was basic. Luggage is delayed, today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say ""call after 72 hours"". Tracking system is very vague, had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver on Jan 2nd. I offered to collect baggage but very vague answer ""call the Airport"", asked her for BA phone number at YVR but she said ""we don't have a phone number for you to call, call the main Airport"". Their policy states you can make a claim only after 21 days."
12,"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. The ""Priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery."
13,"✅ Trip Verified | Definitely not recommended, especially for business class. The seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight. The service however has been great. My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months. Never again unless there is no other choice. By the way, the business class lounge south at Heathrow is a cattle pen."
14,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA shuttle service across the UK is still surprisingly a good product. When compared with BA long haul that doesn’t always get the best of comments at times. It’s reasonable priced, works well, fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk. I don’t know why they still offer a COVID style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service. Currently they have an on line sky cafe but it’s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips."
15,"✅ Trip Verified | I must admit like many others I tend to avoid BA long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews. But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that’s about it. IFE didn’t work but wasn’t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon."
16,"Not Verified |  When will BA update their Business class cabin - 8 across on a 777. It is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were, but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares! As for having to pay to reserve a specific seat - an antiquated idea. The cabin staff were fine, food acceptable, check-in OK and Business lounge (breakfast) acceptable. The lack of space in the seating area, small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing. Having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive. "
17,✅ Trip Verified |  Paid £200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy. At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10. With the luggage fiasco I can't rate it more than 4/10.
18,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA website did not work (weirdly deleted my flight from ""upcoming flights"" on the day of departure). Chaos at Cape Town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down. Chaos at the gate / no queue management for premium passengers. Very nice new A350 with smart new club suite. Champagne warm (cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold, which is not true as Air France manage it). Disappointing meal, wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives. Cheese ice cold and tasteless (why can't the champagne / white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese?). Good IFE system but mediocre film selection. Disappointing breakfast. Overall: 3 / 10. Flew Air France business the month before which was way better. So sad what's become of BA."
19,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience with British Airways. After a short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, they couldn't get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight (on Cathay Pacific) to Melbourne, despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights. Told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to Melbourne - instead, it got to Hong Kong and left there. When they finally tracked it down, they sent it back to London. All happened over Christmas, so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team. While the plane crew may be lovely, the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful, and if given the option, I will avoid flying with them in future."
20,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for. "
21,"✅ Trip Verified |  Old A320 with narrow pitch. Flight perfectly on time, with constant announcements from cockpit. Friendly staff, free chips and water. Quick luggage delivery at T5."
22,"✅ Trip Verified |  Another BA Shambles. Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October. As always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots."
23,"Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. On the face of it, that was sensible as the weather in Iceland was appalling. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad. If they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed. I am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed! Do they not check these things? Any help from BA offered - not really."
24,"Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later! My car was at Heathrow. I didn't want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage, especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience. BA have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey we've booked this year. We are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service."
25,"✅ Trip Verified | Turned up 3.5 hours in advance, Terminal 5 at London Heathrow was already carnage, 100s of people trying to check in, only 5 desks manned. Long queues at security due to only 4 lines open. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the whole day. Arrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn’t arrive with me. Filed a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offer. I now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t know if I will be reimbursed. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. I will personally avoid BA in future at all costs."
26,"Not Verified |  Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew. We will not be looking to fly BA over Virgin in future."
27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Missing baggage customer service was the worst I’ve ever experienced. I arrived back in Phoenix on Sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on Monday, but it took three more days before they were finally delivered. I understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in London my luggage did not make it onto my final flight. I filled out the required form at the Phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where I received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email, but no email was received. I made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and I should hear back within 24 hours. Finally the email with the tracking number was received on Tuesday night. I went online with the tracking number on Wednesday and it requested that I provide the same information that I had given them on the form at the airport. My luggage was finally delivered on Thursday afternoon. "
28,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. She kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there."
29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Stupidly tried BA again after a five year gap and paid over £7000 for my wife and I to go to Barbados because I thought the new Business Class layout might rival Virgin Atlantic on the route. About six months ago BA announced they were switching planes to the old antique push-me-pull-you layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics. Sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room (eight seats across), worn out fittings, inedible food and surly FAs."
30,Not Verified |  Seat horribly narrow; 3-4-3 on a 777. Thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out. Food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows! Cabin crew very good. Booked as a BA ticket that included travel on Qatar Airways as well.
31,"✅ Trip Verified |  Glasgow to London delayed by 1 hour. My wife and I now accept that a BA flight will be late and delayed. Very rarely on time. As long as you accept this, you won’t be disappointed planning ahead. There’s a high risk of delays. If you are connecting with another airline with OneWorld it’s extremely risky."
32,"✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300. I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better. I've obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades, but everything else was good."
33,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Prague to LHR. Excellent service, attentive staff, first drink service, then meal service (choice of three meals), later second drink service. In reality - excellent flight. Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet). I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you. I was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink. Why would we bother serving you also a scone. Hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew).  Crew busy chatting at the galley. In reality - the service could not get any worse. One just must ask what do you pay the premium price for? "
34,"✅ Trip Verified |  Disappointing again especially on business. The service is ancient, one world lounges are a catastrophe at Heathrow. Business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard. "
35,✅ Trip Verified |  During both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent meal. We received a tiny bag of chips and a very small bottle of water. What outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldn't even order any food / drink because the card reader didn't function. The first and last time we'll fly with BA.
36,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day. "
37,"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked a BA holiday to Marrakech, after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit, I can now confirm that the points have been credited. It took a while but BA did eventually make good on their promise, thank you. Based on things now being resolved I have travelled on BA since and I am booked to travel to South Africa in First class on 2nd January, looking forward to the new BA Concorde lounge. Keep it up BA, loyalty is indeed a 2way street."
38,"✅ Trip Verified | Extremely sub-par service. Highlights: No online meal selection. Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. Last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. Plates were literally grabbed away. I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. No apology. No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. Staff walked down with some water and biscuits. This got exhausted just before she got to me. She just looked at me and walked away. Nothing further was offered."
39,"✅ Trip Verified |  I virtually gave up on British Airways about three years ago, writing off my Avios and opting for other airlines. But my return flights from Heathrow to Lisbon this week were very good. The aircraft were pretty much full, but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. A particular shout-out to a flight attendant called Jo, but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive. I'm going to have to start spending those Avios."
40,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. The flight from Montreal was my return flight to Scotland, but I originally booked to fly to and from Toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and I rebooked for a cheaper flight. The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. As well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights."
41,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is late, their website is atrocious, and they wouldn't let me check-in until 24 hours before the flight. I have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website, and/or find a real person to speak with. Customer service had such a thick accent I didn't think they were speaking English. "
42,✅ Trip Verified | Flew from Amman to London on Nov. 14 2022. Not sure what type of aircraft it was. My Ticket was economy plus. The flight is 5h35m. We received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. Any other food or drink had to be purchased. So we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. It is the third time I have flown with BA recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it.
43,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA."
44,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Overall experience 2/10. Flew Air France (Fortalaza to CDG to LHR) two weeks earlier which was way better. How embarrassing for BA."
45,"Not Verified | Worst experience ever. Outbound flight was cancelled and I was not notified. I was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip. Inbound flight delayed 1 hour, also not notified. On top of it, they boarded my hand luggage, which was the only bag I had. Extra wait in Milan then. Food is horrible."
46,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a shambles at BWI, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. The bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! The plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. Overall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey."
47,✅ Trip Verified | Beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to BA. Two pieces reported 29th September. BA responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. All this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. Disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.
48,"✅ Trip Verified | On July 19th 2022 I had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that BA had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to Italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them, for which I had provided all copy of receipts for. I requested for my expenses to be reimbursed, they agreed, I sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks I will be receiving it. It's 4 months later and British Airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on the matter."
49,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked the flight on Oct 8, but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that I can't get my entry visa in time for the flight. And I did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. But in the cancellation email, the booking reference number is a different one. So I requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email? I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. Based on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. Given all I have experienced, I have zero faith in British Airways."
50,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where BA aim to be positioned at of late. The A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight. The flight was punctual but I felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience. 
51,"Not Verified |  I’ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route I’m after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board. We’re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in July for the cancellation of our flight to Miami in March. This was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight !"
52,"✅ Trip Verified |  A great flight. The suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort. British has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc Food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. Service was ok, I prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference. Entertainment was good as was connectivity. No real complaints except a minor one. The tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position. I actually felt like I was in a true business class, not by Qatar’s standards, but that’s another story."
53,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am happy to say that this flight was quite good. Except for the second rate Euro business seating, everything was very well done. A friendly, informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about Heathrow transit. Well done. Unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival."
54,"✅ Trip Verified |  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys."
55,"✅ Trip Verified |  A very positive experience with BA. Seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep. Food was fine but not outstanding. Wi-Fi good, and video screen large and bright. Baggage came out very quickly at Heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to Atlanta. All in all, would fly BA again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats."
56,"✅ Trip Verified | Baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. A380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)"
57,"✅ Trip Verified |  Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380. Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. Boarding was very poorly managed. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. All in, it was an uneventful journey and I would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention."
58,"✅ Trip Verified |  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain."
59,"✅ Trip Verified |  While entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that I was suffocating. I got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. Other then that when I called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response. "
60,"Not Verified |  LHR-LAX. I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is a whole other story. Once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Nice landing at LAX. All in all BA was just fine."
61,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew back to UK from Miami in new Club World Suite - a huge improvement on the elderly Yin and Yang style Club World. Boarding easy. Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future."
62,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with hand baggage but security at Dubai was quick. Entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound. Flight on A380 left on time. Few technical issues with IFE which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight. Decent snack and slept well. Arrivals lounge excellent. Would recommend.
63,"Not Verified | London to Cairo. First, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water. Even Southwest is more generous. When unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit the FA call button with no response for more than an hour. When the FA came to collect garbage I had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter. He used his phone to place the order."
64,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is specifically about Maddie, crew member who took care of us. She was attentive, warm, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Smiling from start to finish. She should be the brand ambassador for BA."
65,"✅ Trip Verified |  5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft, no inflight entertainment. In economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase."
66,"Not Verified |  DFW-LHR. Had an easy transfer at DFW from American Airlines to British Airways heading to London. First ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice. Was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. The seat itself wasn't too bad but I felt squished and locked in. On a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. Plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. Dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. The entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games. All in all it was an OK experience and did get me to London on time and our baggage arrived safely, but I'm not sold on the A380. T5 at LHR is another story that will be in a different review. What a mess that place is."
67,✅ Trip Verified |  Check in at Jersey straightforward. There is a small business class lounge at Jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food. Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHR. Captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at Heathrow. Good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served. Disappointing that the wait for cases at Heathrow T5 was as long as the flight!
68,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in at LHR T5 was very quick and queue for security short. We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. In spite of some of the issues with BA, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. Flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly."
69,"✅ Trip Verified | The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation."
70,"✅ Trip Verified | This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class."
71,"✅ Trip Verified |  My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination. If I have a choice, I will never travel BA again. Such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs."
72,"Not Verified |  I would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey! I don’t know how you manage to keep smiling. Couldn’t fault anything. Helpful, reassuring, excellent food and I can’t wait to fly again. Thank you and I really appreciated you."
73,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways personnel was just magnificent. My flight into London was delayed, security had long lines, I ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board (the software program was already closed). This while the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line. I was sweating from the run, still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board. I bolted again into the plane feeling bad that I did not personally thank her for her magic. I really hope she gets recognized by British Airways for her performance. Thank you for all you do !"
74,Not Verified |  Good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39J and lack of good leg room. Meal was good from Singapore. Should be more snacks on board. My neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didn’t work.
75,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was 1 hour late leaving gate. Crew were friendly. Seats comfortable. But the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps.
76,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Istanbul. British Airways Business Class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty. Front rows about 5-7 are considered as Business Class, with very short leg space.  No pillows, no blanket, horrible inflight service, staff were harassing me. No curtesy for business Class check-in while waiting for flights. "
77,Not Verified | London to Manchester. British Airways is probably the worst air company I have ever flown with they took 2 hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour. The staff were no help and frankly rude.
78,Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled at the last minute due to “weather” despite pretty much all other flights not being affected. Booked onto a flight the next day. Arrived at the airport 2.5 hours ahead T5. Horrendous check-in and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight. The flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done.
79,"✅ Trip Verified |  After having a few not so good experiences in the past, I feel I have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved. First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. I am still not clear on luggage being labelled ""priority"". The luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports."
80,"Not Verified |  This review is for BA booking system not a flight . Today I clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. I then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately I received a response saying my voucher is on its way. I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost. In the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up."
81,✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Seattle via London. I will never fly BA again. They cancelled my return flight from Heathrow back to Manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. We had to get our son come all the way to London to pick us up and take us to our car in Manchester. The food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night. I will not be flying BA again
82,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight in March 2022 from San Francisco to London on 28th March was cancelled with 3 hours’ notice. We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama."
83,"Not Verified |  I sat in seat 25C. Our Cabin Crew lady was called Gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy. She greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile, she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books. Her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing. She had time for a quick chat and I think she said she was half German and half Bulgarian, a really lovely young lady who is a credit to British Airways."
84,"✅ Trip Verified |  Full afternoon flight. Ready to fly on time. Arrived early. Uneventful flight. Good service. Pre dinner drinks. Drink with meal. Coffee, Drinks available at back. AVML meal was tasty. Hard working crew on a full flight. Audio worked well."
85,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was told I'd require a 48 hr negative covid test for entry into Philippines. Booked my trip via BA.com, with a transfer in Singapore. They delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when I try to check in at Changi Airport, the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. Had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush back to check in ...the gate had closed.  Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  I discovered Oman Air Business Class and better then British Airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience."
86,"✅ Trip Verified |  Having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from Heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. I was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no help at there to find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers. So for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with BA."
87,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a business class customer. British Airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with 3 stops. After I complained, they changed the date. When I told them the date would not work, they attempted to charge me additional $5,000 for the change. I submitted a complaint and have not heard anything.  If you try to reach out, no chance."
88,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barbara Collins was super helpful. My boyfriend & I booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate, slightly later one. Barbara was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together & even managed to put us sitting together! Much appreciate BA! We had a terrific flight over. Food, drinks & nibbles were great & staff were so friendly. Looking forward to returning home with BA."
89,"Not Verified |  My husband, parents who are in their 80’s and I were traveling back to NY from Naples, Italy and had a stopover at Heathrow, London. Let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to London and missed our connecting flight back to NY. The reason writing this review is the great customer service that Kashmir Dhami gave us. She was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done! She is so kind and is amazing at her job."
90,"Not Verified |  On our recommendation my son and his young family (child 4 and baby 9 months) and wife, flew BA to the USA from Cape Town, leaving yesterday evening. Just got off the call with him, after their arrival at Heathrow. Shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from RSA, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. My grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. Last one was told ""wait till drinks are served!"" Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it Sir"", that sealed it for us, if that’s the BA response to what’s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate."
91,"Not Verified |  We had a nice flight. pushed-off exactly on time. Cabin crew very efficient in all things; friendly for the most part as well. Dinner (hot!) and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good. Do avoid middle seats though, even in premium economy. Only issue was with indifferent/non-helpful BA call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance. Nice start to a 3 week trip to England."
92,"✅ Trip Verified |  Holidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights I travelled from London Heathrow to Amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn't take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin, so they sent them to the cargo. At our arrival in Amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in Amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don't have the suitcase or any information about it. Today I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase was missing, left in Amsterdam. 2 Suitcases, 2 different flights, they've ruined my holidays. No compensation, no dates on when will I get my property back, no information, lies and more lies.  I was told I could complain online and buy all the things I need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and I might receive the money back in 30 days! Yes, I might."
93,✅ Trip Verified | Despite BA's promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website I have received no additional points and my four email communications (including to the Chief Executive) have remained unanswered. Do not be taken in by this marketing con - they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises. Some things just do not change at BA.
94,"✅ Trip Verified |  Refund process is non responsive I have been following up on my refund since October, 2021 which is 9 months now. I have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to [email protected] several times and all they tell me is it’s been processed. British Airways customer service is bad and needs to be worked on. Till today I have not received my refund. I am just wondering what is happening!"
95,"✅ Trip Verified |  Customer service is non-existent. For over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks. Nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on BA.com I was flying to Nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly, My sister and husband had tickets on the July 18 from Nairobi to JFK. When BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. It took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. My niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back. The ticket was in premium economy. When I tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. Where is the efficiency? Where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight. Also when I made my reservation, i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $1400.00 increase. British Airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion. Words simply don't convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company"
96,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight on A380 SFO to LHR. Smooth check in at San Francisco. Airport quiet and efficient. Dedicated BA lounge, excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff. Lounge was very crowded though. Minor departure delay and onto A380 upper deck. I prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter. Old style product but clean and well maintained. Staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals. On time arrival, baggage quite slow. A good flight overall."
97,"✅ Trip Verified |  For this 5 hour 15 min flight, you are given a bag of potato chips, and a bottle of water. If you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. Or like me you can pre-order weeks before you fly. However there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. They also managed to lose my luggage.  I am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. I will never use them again."
98,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK. "
99,"Not Verified |  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands. Seems British Airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yet. apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight. "
100,Not Verified |  Reasonably smooth boarding. Meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley - could they have offered to serve this afterwards? Seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight. Cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn't sleep even if the seats were comfortable. This was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.
101,"✅ Trip Verified |  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor."
102,✅ Trip Verified | Routine typical BA domestic shuttle flight. Nothing special. Departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a 30 minute delay. Crew were attentive and charming. Usual clean cut BA product that when it works well is fine.
103,"✅ Trip Verified |  Over 1 week ago I cancelled 2 Club Europe flights due to testing positive for Covid the day before. They were booked many months ago and eligible for the Travel Voucher, so I opted for this online. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. With a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare."
104,Not Verified |  Flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down. Luggage never made it to Toronto and we filed a lost baggage report. Within 24 hours our luggage arrived in Toronto and a wonderful BA representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me. Would definitely give BA a 5 star rating and have them again.
105,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight."
106,"✅ Trip Verified | Washington to London. Our flight was unexpectedly cancelled. My husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. We were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). When we finally rebooked we still lost one day, one day of lodging, and tickets to a show. We tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us. No one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money. We are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here!"
107,"Not Verified | Nairobi to New York via London. British Airways has given me such grief, trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away, they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking. It is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight, and I have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours I have spent on hold, or with an agent, being told that my query has been prioritized and that I will receive a call back within 48 hours. I call every 2-3 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation. I will never book with BA again. Sure, flying with them is easy, but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time. And to think I spent more money on a ticket with BA than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier. BIG MISTAKE"
108,"Not Verified |  Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag. I hadn't flown BA in many years and with experience I would never book them again."
109,"Not Verified |  British Airways is poorly staffed at Venice airport. No one to check in 2 flights departing within 15 minutes of each other 1.5 hours before. Huge line snaking through airport. Flight crew fine. London to Baltimore segment on an older 787, usually they are much nicer. Limited TV and movie selections, wifi did not work. Flight crew ok, food adequate."
110,"Not Verified |  I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent Flyer points. I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles. When I asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation, they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable. I read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable."
111,"✅ Trip Verified |  Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. I am going to explore other options before using BA again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport."
112,"Not Verified |  Was going from Belfast to London but they cancelled the flight, and we didn’t even know it was cancelled. Someone behind us had to tell us. we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday. the refund takes ages. Overall not happy at all. "
113,"Not Verified |  Second time getting poor service from BA. 1st, unable to contact via phone, email or website. 2nd even with four business class tickets across the Atlantic, they do not allow free seat selection or check in until 24 hours prior to the flight. Do they understand what the last 24 hours of an international trip are like? By the time we confirmed our seats my wife and our kids were spread throughout the plane. Of course no-one at the airport could do anything. "
114,"Not Verified |  Booked a flight from London to Paris 2020. Trip was cancelled due to Covid lockdowns. We asked BA staff for refund, told cannot do but will issue vouchers. We stated no good for two elderly people from Australia as would not know when we can travel. Informed no other option and silly vouchers sent. Now they are running out of date and unusable! Have been asking for two years for refund! Many many emails. They keep saying we took vouchers! Had no choice. Does anyone have any other options re complaints! We would be most grateful. Really not fair to just take our money! "
115,"Not Verified |  We left MIA late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane. We arrived late and so missed our connection at LHR to CDG. At LHR British Airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to CDG and as such said I never took the flight to CDG and then cancelled my flight back to MIA since I did not take my flight. They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I never took it. Thus I had to book on another airline to return at the last moment. Trying to call BA was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped. BA cost me $5800 overall. We have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again. They under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates - don’t be fooled."
116,"Not Verified |  The flight was delayed over 6 hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route, finally I lost my luggage and no one has any information. I will never again travel with British Airways."
117,"Not Verified |  Terrible experience with British Airways! I was obligated to check-in my carry-on suitcase due to my group number, according to the girl at the front desk. Then, they could miss my two suitcases, plus the luggage of my boyfriend, who traveled with me. After 3 days, they delivered 2 of our 3 bags, and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists. Now, already 10 days passed, and still no information of where the last suitcase is. Always the promise that the bag will be delivered today, but it never happens! No respect with the customer! First and last time with British Airways for sure! I don't recommend at all!!"
118,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022. Your claim's been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. Further to your request, I would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. We take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. The cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. Thanks again for following this up with us. Please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and I hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. Best regards British Airways Customer Relations"". I don't know what ""non payable commercial reason"" is. I am out about 250 sterling, going to just leave it their and boycott this company."
119,"✅ Trip Verified |  Belfast to London on 20 Jun, 0650. I was informed at about 0200 flight BA1427 has been delayed to 0915, will only reach London Heathrow at 1025. I reached the airport at 0445, but BA counter was only open at 0510. At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline, there’s nothing we can do”. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales. For the next 2 hrs in the airport, I have been trying to contact BA, but was told that hotline only operates from 0800, I have to called another number for “urgent cases”, which ever number I dial, I just couldn’t get to speak to any one till 0757. Again, I was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore Airlines. Onboard the aircraft, when I approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment, I was told that it’s the customer’s responsibility to do it on their own.  I would think twice to take BA in the future."
120,"Not Verified |  The customer service of British Airways is really bad. You can't reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins. Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA's low quality customer service. Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co. Overall my rating is 2/5 for BA - you can feel how stingy BA is when you fly with them. Note: Respect to their cabin crew"
121,"✅ Trip Verified | BA is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. Seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. Good old times of being a glamour flying BA has far gone. Ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. The only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. For the price they charge I advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. You pay extra for absolutely nothing."
122,"✅ Trip Verified |  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia."
123,"✅ Trip Verified |  As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin. I end where I started, BA standards continue to slip. "
124,"Not Verified |  Right now do not use British Airways. When booking, person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination, but he was wrong. Flight to London was late, we auto missed our flight to Edinburgh, and had to wait 9 hours for the next flight. Coming back once again flight leaving was late, had to run to get connecting flight, then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so I thought good, that is probably my luggage. Once back in Boston luggage did not show up. They said we would get it within 24 hours and we didn't, so far it will be at least 2 days."
125,"Not Verified |  I could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing. This was a risk I was well aware about when travelling to Greece for my wedding. However, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upset. The company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband. The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”. After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone). I will never use this company again nor will anyone that I am close to. This has been completely disheartening. Please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication. I have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before."
126,"✅ Trip Verified |  The A80 is a wonderful aircraft - quieter than any other aircraft I've flown. Flight was delayed arriving at Vancouver from London, which meant that departing flight from Vancouver was also delayed. Passengers waited almost 90 minutes at London Terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by BA ground staff was that the baggage staff are ""very busy right now"" and our baggage will arrive ""soon."" Onboard amenities and services quite disappointing. Seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support. Meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when I last flown with BA - a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast. Cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight - no offer of water, juice, or other beverages during the flight. Overall, a fairly disappointing experience with BA."
127,"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR to SFO in new Club Suite. Rather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengers. Pushback delayed by lack of tug. Club Suite seats (2K/3K) a huge improvement over previous CW product, with excellent IFE and a good range of movies. Cabin crew attentive and efficient. Food adequate and still served on the same tray. Arrival more or less on time, but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge. Long queue to get through immigration."
128,✅ Trip Verified | Covid form is broken - Called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone. 1 hour flight delay - was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when I entered the plane. I explained that I really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as I have 3 hours drive left after I arrive at the airport. In short: totally not customer friendly. Will try to avoid flying next time with BA.
129,"Not Verified |  Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?"
130,"Not Verified |  Phoenix to London Heathrow and then to Hamburg. Despite a 4 hour layover in Heathrow, bags didn't make it onto the connecting flight. Once in Hamburg, there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead-end; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee. A group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail. The solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description. Four days later, no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service. Absolutely miserable customer support. Our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly BA again."
131,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline experience ever. Flew 7 people business class. Check in was a disaster. The claimed I had “exchanged” tickets. After 1.5 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes. We were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later. The connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. The ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. Then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage. Calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone. This airline is a complete disaster, please do not fly them. "
132,✅ Trip Verified |  The crew BA656 on 6 June absolutely made this flight. Smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew I've ever had. Rebooking for September we were that impressed.
133,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled on the 11th April with my baby in economy class, flight BA 2260 and BA 2508. I had the pleasure of meeting Sarah air stewardess. She was absolutely amazing. I received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond. It was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated. She repeatedly asked if I needed anything as I had Arham in my lap most of the time. She held him whilst I had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft. We had a chat and the service was just amazing. It is something I will never forget. Thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight. I have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated. Hope you see this."
134,"✅ Trip Verified |  Outstanding inflight service from the crew. Friendly, professional and helpful. The very best of British. Even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at Vancouver, it didn’t matter. The crew made the flight outstanding."
135,"✅ Trip Verified |  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I would definitely consider flying with them again."
136,"Not Verified |  My son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines.. But his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached Toronto in time. We are thankful to British Airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son, especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic. Unfortunately, people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively. The flight was very expensive though as we booked late, after being dumped by Air Canada / Swiss air, after they cancelled their flight at the last moment."
137,"✅ Trip Verified |  As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge. However they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that I incurred as a result of their mistake."
138,"Not Verified |  Boarding on time, but unfortunately from ORT’s worst boarding gate, which obviously was beyond BA’s control. Crew were good but lacked the personal touch. Old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space, and the 777 was showing it’s age. However we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites. The cabin crew were good, food ok, wines a little disappointing. Overall a decent flight."
139,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight delays can happen, but the way BA handles such incidents in just way beyond. Our flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours. Rechecking our bags took 4 hours standing in line. A rebooking to an earlier connection was denied, be it online or at the counter. Will certainly never fly BA again and do not recommend this airline."
140,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Easy boarding in sequence numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. The outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. Overall shocking from British Airways and can guarantee I will never use them again."
141,"Not Verified |  British Airways - Travel with Confidence. Probably the most unsuitable tag line, they should be ashamed. Back in October I booked a holiday to Punta Cana with BA only to have it cancelled early in 2022. Late last year I also booked Heathrow to Malaga for a family wedding in May. Guess what, a few weeks ago that also got cancelled. I had the chance to rebook with BA but with so many cancellations planned I was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event, so applied for and received a refund. I have now also asked for my Executive Club account to be closed as I shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline. My suggestion is if you want to 'travel with confidence' choose another airline. Any airline."
142,Not Verified |  Business class seating shown as a 2x2 configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat - not much more comfortable than economy. Meal service started with three options but was down to 2 options by row 5 (out of 8 in business class) and by row 6 where we were seated only one of us had 2 options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class.
143,✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to BA was terrible. The airport security lines were not managed well. The gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate (with asthma). It was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced. All the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience. Amsterdam is the worst airport I have experienced. 
144,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me. They do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours."
145,"Not Verified |  I have been battling a long overdue refund with BA regarding a flight originally booked in 2019... The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. Honestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline. I suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now."
146,"✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for Covid travel, but I did not have it, I tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my bank (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document. When I checked in for the Mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issues. Every time I fly with BA, I have a bad experience and I promise I will never fly with them again. "
147,✅ Trip Verified |  Another dreadful mediocre experience with BA to Malaga. This time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no Aircon. Then on flight the the Wi-Fi was erratic and guests couldn’t order food or drinks. Then the card payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering. Finally at Malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case 'we' caused the plane to go unbalanced? Really? It’s all one excuse after another with BA these days.
148,"Not Verified | Basel to Johannesburg via London. Cancelled connection flight: confusing UI, still shows cancelled booking in my bookings, never sent a confirmation email for new flights.  Cant check-in. Could check-in online or via the app. Customer service is non-existent. Busy line, after 45min still no one there to help me check in."
149,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very low standards for Club Europe: there was no cabin divider in the aircraft, so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected, aircraft not properly cleaned in Athens (there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket). No in-flight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from European routes which is a shame. Staff was attentive though and tried their best."
150,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business Class. Also, the Premium Economy product came across much better in the Boeing 787 than in the old B747 or even than in the B777. Seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room. Food, service and entertainment options were good. Clearly worth the extra money for Premium Economy."
151,"Not Verified |  British Airways continues to decline in customer service. I used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers. The most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company. Even as part of the Executive Club (Silver) I continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support. At this rate, they have lost my trust."
152,"Not Verified |  On my flight from LAX to LHR I paid to pick my seat for my flight back to LAX. I saw the $116 come out of my account the next day. As I’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached out anyway because I was unable to find another way to contact them. On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking. I’m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again. I’m extremely frustrated."
153,"✅ Trip Verified | Amazing flight and comfortable. The premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest. New aircraft. Staff very friendly and professional. The food was great, beyond expectation."
154,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and I was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. I spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor."" In the end, BA managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and I booked with another airline on principle. "
155,"Not Verified |  We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg. Compared to having flown with other airlines I will never fly with BA again, the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect."
156,✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank you for the great service. I am a handicap and my family and I were afraid of this trip because I was flying alone and had a layover in London of a few hours. I had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing. They took great care of me and made sure I was doing well throughout the whole flight.
157,"✅ Trip Verified | I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit."
158,"Not Verified |  We flew from Dubrovnik to Heathrow on the 24th April 2022. Check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious. When boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off. Once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at Heathrow slightly early. Overall a very pleasant trip. We will be flying again with British Airways"
159,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. Having paid almost £1K extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket. The poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline I have had to endure. "
160,"✅ Trip Verified | Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers."
161,"Not Verified |  Our Good Friday flight was delayed by 5hours, STD 12.50 ATD 18.00 TO Durban, South Africa from Johannesburg. There were no announcements made, when approached no time frame was given, they simply didn't know. An aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at Johannesburg. Crew arrived late. The aircraft was filthy. We shall never fly Comair again that includes Kulula or BA absolutely shocking service."
162,Not Verified |  We had a trip with 4 flights included. All 4 flights were delayed. The worst with 2h15min. Also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation. No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays. I expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. This was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.
163,"Not Verified |  My first time in the new Club World suite. Excellent, lots of space and privacy, very good seat. I doubt if this can be bettered. Good staff as ever. My only quibble is that the food is all served at once. BA needs to roll this out quickly!"
164,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April 2022. Zero empathy towards me a struggling customer. Second situation happened when we arrived into Nice Terminal 1 on BA0262 13 April where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery. When our luggage arrived at Nice airport the day after and received an email from the AVIA Partner lost and found (British Airways Partner) at 13:14PM informing us that our luggage has now arrived in Nice. After multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that I did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in Monaco, it was vital we received the luggage ASAP, the lady replied “If it is so important why don’t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning. This has been an appalling experience."
165,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a business class flight with Qantas from Melbourne to Glasgow via London. As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed. I have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline I have ever flow on and I can guarantee I will never fly British Airways again. "
166,"Not Verified |  The service was very good, the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size. The seat was comfortable for economy and because the A380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor, there was a lot of space. The food was good for airplane food. The only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn't good quality, however there was a large selection of movies and TV shows"
167,"✅ Trip Verified |  Total chaos for departures immigration at Malaga Airport. Boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.
"
168,"Not Verified |  Shout out to the help desk at Heathrow, we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady (with 32 years exp) was great, she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay, food to eat and a flight home the next day."
169,"Not Verified |  I am constantly amazed how British Airways continue to get things wrong - I pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last 15 years living in the UK, I have watched their decline with great sadness. My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend. Never again."
170,"✅ Trip Verified |  The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline. "
171,"✅ Trip Verified |  A very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good food. Crew was wonderful New seat is great, except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable. Entertainment great. Wifi was annoying, cutting off and needing constant reconnecting. Generally a positive experience."
172,"✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is the most terrible airline I’ve dealt with. They have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online. They hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. You can’t check in online, the application sucks so much you’re better off trying to code your own app and it’ll probably work better, every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can’t verify your documents yet the app and website say you’re verified and ready to go. You upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return.  I hope I never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with British Airways ever again."
173,✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is the most terrible airline I’ve ever dealt with.

They hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. I have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip we’d booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in Japan as BA just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers.
174,"Not Verified |  BA is getting a real bashing on this forum and I thought I'd buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from EDI to LCY on BA8703 this Monday. Easy check in, decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers, very clean plane which left on time, ridiculous amount of legroom in 2D (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1A or C), reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable CSM and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled. What's not to like, which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my BA experiences over the last 25 years. Anyway I thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once."
175,"Not Verified |  New Club Suites are amazing, the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow I have ever used. Food was ok as I have had better on BA in the past and I can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is OK. The cabin crew were brilliant but I was surprised that after dinner the crew didn’t once come round with beverages or even bottled water. BA really have a great hard product here and I would suspect the soft product will improve once Covid restrictions become less of an issue. Well done BA."
176,✅ Trip Verified | Very small plane for a busy route. Service was good but food not so. Ran out of a lot and options left were not good. Cabin crew for BA actually really friendly.
177,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service, provided by people who shouldn't be in customer service, on tired, dirty and cramped aircraft. Out of 11 flights this year, not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on-time. Including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so BA cancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the US. "
178,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew back on BA0254 Bridgetown to Heathrow in the old Club Class. A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. Even tried to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. My wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and F. Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. As usual when BA is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's awful. I recommend hesitatingly - come on BA, be great again. We pay a lot for ""premium"" seats."
179,"Not Verified |  The worst budget airline I’ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. It took three days to return it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but I’ll be pursuing for compensation. I have some free flights from Amex but I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again."
180,"✅ Trip Verified | First, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR, GVA-LHR & LHR-ZRH), first 2 in Economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. The infrastructure however is appalling. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. Onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10."
181,"✅ Trip Verified |  Have not flown economy with BA for years, what a shock! Hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment. Food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. And no antibacterial wipes offered. Wi-Fi advertised but not available on flight. Paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to Easy Jet, RyanAir or JetStar. My last time travelling with BA after more than 18 years of flying with them. BA you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship Service you used to be."
182,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to Barbados 16 March on BA 255 in the new Club Class suite. A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat. Come on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. I recommend with the usual caveats."
183,"Not Verified |  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case."
184,"Not Verified |  Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. No snacks were offered during the flight. This is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos. If ever you decide to fly with them I suggest that you bring your own food. We certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again."
185,"✅ Trip Verified |  Complete and utter chaos at Heathrow, yet again. Surely the CEO, Sean Doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous IT problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed. The queue for the First Wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour, and subsequent flight to Malaga 1.5 hrs late leaving the gate. Updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - BA seems to think this is normal practice nowadays. As Emerald OneWorld, I wish there was an alternative because BA has become intolerable, and this is after flying them for 55 years since BEA/BOAC days."
186,"Not Verified |  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy. There is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from."
187,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow."
188,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy."
189,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely bad experience with "" British Airways."" I have two bookings with them for the past two years. both were cancelled. The first one, I understand, "" Covid-19"" unexpected. But today I got another surprise. My flight to Antalya in May 2022 was cancelled and no explanation is given. I will definitely not book ever again with them."
190,"Not Verified |  Flew BA LHR-AUS on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the A350-1000 on the return leg. Seats comfortable. Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready. Having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs, paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it. Baggage was received fine at AUS and LHR - the latter took ages on return. If I had the option of another airline - I would not fly BA."
191,Not Verified |  The food was awful. An over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing. Terrible. Then went to a Traditional Breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash brown's. Such rubbish on BA.
192,"✅ Trip Verified | I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again."
193,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dubai. Family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old, savvy travelers, been on many holidays so we were excited to be on BA for first time. But disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7am. We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. Food was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be good. Movies are all outdated and already watched. So overall very medium experience."
194,"✅ Trip Verified | One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. How on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline."
195,"Not Verified |  We will never use BA again for a long haul flight. Our experience of the flight from LHR-MLE wasn’t too bad, apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience. We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen. We weren’t fed until 1.5hrs before we landed (it was a 11.5hr flight) and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato! BA just don’t care anymore about the little people."
196,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is getting worse an worse, my flight was 8 mins late. Luggage is taking hours to arrive.  No communication whatsoever from anyone. They can't be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails, if they do. My app is crashing most of the times. They change the aircraft without notice, so even if you pay for a seat, the staff will say there is nothing they can do."
197,✅ Trip Verified | Paid for 3 business class seats to London from New York. Got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class. Couldn’t even provide compensation or a refund. Told I had to call customer service or submit a form. Unbelievable. Unacceptable. Never again. 
198,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely shambolic customer service. The lounges at Heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible, waited over an hour for my chosen food/drink order to be brought to me. Ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so. On board product is average. "
199,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight back to Athens (on a different airline) was very delayed, causing us to miss our first flight home. I understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. What's worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found, causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets. The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with, and I will never be flying with them again."
200,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. No airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight. First time using BA premium and likely my last."
201,"✅ Trip Verified |  There was a mistake on my booking made by BA. Got an email to say ""contact us to discuss"". Took over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolved. Absolutely the most shambolic customer support I have ever experienced. Still waiting for the call back I was promised 2 weeks ago."
202,"✅ Trip Verified | The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage."
203,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways continues to go downhill. We flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. We were packed in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day before. Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch and width is the same as economy. Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. COVID is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful."
204,"✅ Trip Verified |  Outstanding! From the warm, smiling welcome on board, this flight was excellent. The in flight crew were friendly, attentive and very professional. Detailed announcements from the flight deck as well. Food and wine all very good indeed. The Premium Economy product on BA is also very good. Comfortable seats, foot and leg rests and decent recline. FR superior to any other airline on other Atlantic routes."
205,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remains. BA454 from London to Malaga on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and I was one of them. This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned. Cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell. I guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules? "
206,"✅ Trip Verified |  For once more BA got it all wrong with 6 hours delay, food voucher of 4 pounds and no information or advice. No staff to serve the waiting passengers. The attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity."
207,Not Verified |  Another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service. The day after Storm Eunice and English half term holidays are getting underway. So you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays. The fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and European destinations on the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasons was pitiful. You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight. Some BA cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the South Lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at A17 were a disgrace.
208,✅ Trip Verified |  Check in at IAD was quick and easy. Lounge in Washington was a BA lounge and very good. Sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight. Flight on time and boarded promptly. As we had eaten we opted to sleep. There was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it. We slept well. On time arrival and quickly made it to T5 arrivals lounge which was excellent.
209,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very old planes, poor food and minimal leg room in economy. Check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers. Special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored. I spoke to a BA customer service representative as soon as I landed in Heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form. Have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on Twitter. Telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable."
210,Not Verified | Having just booked BA for a return flight - being one hour each way in Club Class and paying + 700 euro for 2 persons to be then asked to pay a further 96 euro to choose seats in business. A full business class ticket and a fee for seat? A very disengaged management model.
211,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA got everything right. Allowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the US. On the day of travel it was half term and the Airport busy. In spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes. Lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. Good range of drinks. Easy transfer to C gates. Aircraft ready, boarding quick and well organised. Pre departure drinks served. The cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. The food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent. Although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained. On time arrival, baggage off very fast. Overall an excellent flight and it feels like BA are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use COVID as an excuse for service cut backs Well done"
212,✅ Trip Verified |  Appalling customer service - they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking. Hours and hours on the telephone with no response (or you just get a recorded message to say they can't take the call). They don't respond to emails sent to the complaints line. 
213,"✅ Trip Verified |  This past November/December I flew Washington-London return and, on the strength of that trip (my first in two years), the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre-pandemic status quo ante. The cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty Hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the BA cabin crews remain the best in the business. This was one of a number of bookings that I had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of many here, my re-bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly (although I did have a number of lengthy waits on hold, but under the present circumstances that's to be expected). It's good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time, and I'm looking forward to future trips on BA."
214,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the best experience I have ever had with an airline. Our initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. I found that booking with them was extremely simple. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. I called the customer service, waited about 20 minutes before I could speak with someone and within 15 minutes, the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. The person on the line was extremely nice, understanding and willing to help us. I had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline. I got the full refund on my credit card the day after. I usually chose the cheapest flight ticket, regardless of the airline, but from now on, I’ll definitely make sure to check with British airways first."
215,"Not Verified | BA cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later. We had no issue with this, just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible. However, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from LHR and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at ATL. The aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. Service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient. Dinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice. The LHR to BHD leg was equally good and I am beginning to think that BA are getting their mojo back again."
216,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall, a good flight."
217,"✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. The bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post iPad era just don’t live up. The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. I’m afraid BA has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels."
218,"Not Verified |  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible. 
"
219,Not Verified | Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing! 
220,"✅ Trip Verified |  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew"
221,"✅ Trip Verified |  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!"
222,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!"
223,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days."
224,"✅ Trip Verified |  The entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. My food left something to be desired. Two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work. The plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. Just overall a very basic generic airline."
225,"✅ Trip Verified |  Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards."
226,"Not Verified | On arrival at the Warsaw Airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. Lady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in desk for Euro Traveller / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.  Flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay, crew on the plane was nice and attentive. Luckily the in air experience was much better, but sort out your ground service at Warsaw Airport."
227,"✅ Trip Verified |  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is."
228,"✅ Trip Verified | After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!"
229,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I'd be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I'd be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I'd be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount."" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. So I emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond. So I called this morning and after explaining politely what I was calling for they hung up on me."
230,"✅ Trip Verified | Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze."
231,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money."
232,"Not Verified |  First of this was one of the smoothest UK to US flights I have taken. The boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. They called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling. The entertainment system is basic, it does not support Bluetooth headphones, the USB does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless.  The crew were nice so sorry I missed that."
233,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying during covid is always a challenge. BA’s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. The bags drop at T5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones. Although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean. The cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. We were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. The food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. Obviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, I arrived relaxed and unstressed."
234,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim. A credit to BA."
235,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. Check in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc. BA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA. The next day I flew the same aircraft type to Bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, Arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. BA hang your head in shame."
236,"✅ Trip Verified |  We've just used the new Club World for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration. The privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared. The wines were warm, they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch, and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet. Heathrow was a nightmare as often happens. Being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in Covid times."
237,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day."
238,"✅ Trip Verified |  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible."
239,"✅ Trip Verified |  I claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of August, they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons. I have sent them a complaint per E-mail and I still didn't get a reply. It has been 4.5 months and I am still waiting for an answer. Furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. When we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service."
240,"✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons. We had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights. BA did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, I am not going to travel on BA again and may not travel again this year at all."
241,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have a flight booked for January 2022, they send me an email at the beginning of December informing me that my flight was changed. My second flight was moved to the next day, making my layover 26 hours, called them, was told to just cancel. What kind of answer is that? I mean I still need to fly to where I am going, and booking with another airline closer to the day I am flying will be more expensive. It is a very big inconvenience for me and I don't even get an apology, just cancel!"
242,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill."
243,"✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I am Gold MVP 100,000+ miler with Alaska Airlines. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was. They explained British Airways had rebooked with Delta. This took about 30mins with customer Service. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. I am so frustrated."
244,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK. "
245,✅ Trip Verified |  I was refused an early check in and was told to come back at 2:30pm for a 5.05pm departure. There was no staff until 2:45 and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger.
246,"✅ Trip Verified | Check in was ok, all documents were scanned without problems. The flight was delayed by 50 minutes due to crew members been stuck on the M25. Not the airlines fault. 3 replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new A321 neo went ahead. The club Europe cabin was 12 rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off. For me at 5.11 tall, I can fit ok, however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room. The inflight service was a a stop - start affair, nothing to write home about. The crew failed to work as a team. You had to go to the galley to get extra drinks. I was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup. Landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal. Not BA's finest hour."
247,"✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at the South airport in Tenerife 2 hours before departure, Iberia had not opened the check in. Even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post COVID took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down. Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. Boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front. Food and drink where very good, served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers. Good selection of wine to go with a above average salad. Overall it was an OK experience with a great cabin crew."
248,"Not Verified |  Check-in very slow. No app check-in and could not check my vaccine QR code online. Check in staff friendly but too few of them. BA Silver card holder and no Stockholm lounge  to use. Boarding fine, but plane was worn out. Seats close together and row 30 even worse.  Crew really professional and happy it seemed. Arrival at Heathrow a total shambles. BA777 landed at 12.50, no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutes. Then BA jetty didn’t work. Then BA had no steps. Very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps. Everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch. So BA skimping on lounge, plane condition and gate. Crew good, seats very uncomfortable."
249,"✅ Trip Verified |  After 1h queuing at the check-in desk, I am told that my booked seat is not available. Why do you sell seats that you do not have?"
250,"Not Verified |  Outbound, seated in row 10, I was told they had run out of my chosen food option (shepherd's pie), so I had to settle for gnocchi. The steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier - as if BA could not get a better one! On the return, boarding from the back, not by priority, then, seated in row 12, I had the last half glass of champagne (only because one of the other passengers in row 12 had declined). Food was rigatoni with vegetables. Overall, penny pinching by BA in club class. Dreadful - not for us again."
251,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Club Europe London - Tenerife South 5 November and returned 12 November. Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. For the fare I would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue. Also not a great lounge - the VIP lounge is merely adequate with OK seating for an hour or two. I would only just about recommend - there are still reservations about exactly what BA is trying to become."
252,"✅ Trip Verified | 3 hours standing in line for boarding pass. Airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically. Then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight. And yes, we used VeriFLY. My flight is now delayed for at least 30 minutes. They are so unorganized and slow! Getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines. You have to wait even though I paid for it. Avoid this airline at all costs! Absolute worst!"
253,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been trying to get a hold of BA to change my return flight for the past week now. I cant change online because I'm flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online. I've tried live chat several times and waited 2.5 hours only to be told there's no one available (during business hours). I have tried calling and the line always drops from their end. Customer service is non existent. However, of course if you call the ""new booking"" line someone immediately picks up of course, however they can't help me nor put me through to anyone apparently. Shambolic excuse of an airline that doesn't deserve to be a national airline. I haven't had these problems at all and I've been flying throughout covid (for work unfortunately). It's been easier to change my flights with domestic Latin American Airlines and I don't even speak Spanish. "
254,"✅ Trip Verified |  This whole experience was sickening, over 3.5 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles. Drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what I wanted to complain about. Would not even allow me to add tier points. The flight to London was marred with problems. In London we received an upgrade email to fast track and VIP lounges due to amount spent. This never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email. We had to change planes to the other side of the airfield. The resort (Riu Paradise Beach) was riddled with bad food, drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staff to sound off too. The return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at Manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday. There is light at the end of this horrid tunnel Virgin Atlantic have just started the same route from this month. Now we all know this is a better option."
255,"Not Verified |  Poorly mismanaged services this time. Disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters, had to wait around 1.5 hours just to check in. Then came the boarding, again had to wait at the passage for 15-30 mins. Finally when we thought things are better now, on reaching London our next boarding pass was not scanned. Around 15-20 passengers including me had to wait from 7.45 am until 1.40 am for the next flight. On boarding the next flight, no space to keep the luggage. Journey was really hectic and did not expect this from BA."
256,Not Verified |  Currently dreading my flight with BA considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called “Live Chat”. All we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me. We just wanted to be able to make a name change. Absolutely impossible. Their website is unusable. Their customer service is a shambles. They couldn’t change the name. Told me that we should’ve done the booking more carefully. Well you’re going to have these people making mistakes. So maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights. Like hello it’s the 21st century. You should have a button saying “Change name”. Anyways not the point. The woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn’t making it clear on what to do. Then when I gave up towards the end of the call I just said “thanks for your help I’ll deal with it la-“ got cut off. 50 minutes and got nothing. All I can say is good luck.
257,✅ Trip Verified | Another BA shuttle flight and a good one. Fantastic flying weather and I would say a 40% load factor. Good professional crew. Friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries. And getting to the A gates at T5 makes for an easy exit. Still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery.
258,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Larnaca to LHR. Check in was ok. The lounge was an Aspire lounge and shared, it was basic but ok. Flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route. There were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this A321. Service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered. It’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great. Drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware, not really interested if I’m being honest when we’ve paid a lot of money for it. Staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be. Club Europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer. The seats are not so comfortable. Not dreadful but something for BA to think about."
259,"✅ Trip Verified |  Upon checking in at the Club desk in Lisbon airport our Passenger Locator Forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our Day 2 test and the check in agent denied us boarding, causing my wife, who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the U.K., much distress. He was only doing his job of course, but we requested him to call a Supervisor. The Check in Manager, Goncalo Ribeiro, came to our rescue.  Not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our Day 2 test, uploading it onto our PLF’s, verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check-in. He was at the Gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey; we could not have asked for better service. He was a very professional ambassador for BA!"
260,"✅ Trip Verified | Club Europe on British Airways. Outstanding and wonderful to have BA back. The welcome on board was warm and sincere. Flight attendants helpful, friendly and professional. Great updates from the flight deck. Super lunch and good choice of wines. BA at its best. Hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new CEO with the departure of Alex Cruz."
261,"Not Verified |  Good flight but boarding was chaos, was gifted with the beautiful A10 gate at LHR T5(, so we were bussed to the plane (first time I've used a bus gate there). The A320 was at T3 at a gate with a jetway, nevertheless 168 passengers (full flight) boarded via steps - this caused an hour waiting at the ""gate"" as well as the baggage taking ages. Also the seat recline on G-GATL (9f) is broken."
262,"✅ Trip Verified |  Usual BA economy trip, pleasant crew. Complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices. I am not a fan of the new NEO aircraft. Very cramped seating and uncomfortable. The armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one. Aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward. I have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me. Other than that BA still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced. This time it was good value."
263,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was easy, security quick, lounge fine. Lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed (which was great). Flight was fine, my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps I agree. There was nothing bad about food but nothing great either. Drinks were fine and proactively served. On arrival efficient PCR testing where it was needed and fast turnaround. Baggage off quick"
264,"Not Verified |  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed. Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option."
265,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review. The flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer, however, on this occasion it was an absolute delight. On both inward and outward journeys, I was impressed by the professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew. I was in economy but was treated with the respect and service I would expect in the first class cabin. My particular thanks must go to Amir, who was absolute joy and a credit to British Airways. I cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge, Thank you so so much."
266,"✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was clean and air quality very good. Timing was perfect. I was seated in 15 K. To begin with , I had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat. When I requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started, I was told that tea would be served after dinner. I did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened. At dinner, there was no tea service. I did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea.  There was no hand soap in the washroom. However, on my way to London from Toronto, my experience was a good one. However, it was not the same on my return flight."
267,✅ Trip Verified |  The service was excellent. The cabin staff were attentive and efficient. The food and drinks were very good. The seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice. Overall a very enjoyable flight.
268,"Not Verified |  I booked and paid for what I thought was a business class seat on a flight to Athens. What I got was a premium economy seat. The first nine rows were business class seats, rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin (but had been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (I was in row 11). This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. I complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way. I also made a formal complaint to BA but was fobbed off. Apparently this is a long running scam, I don’t know how they get away with it."
269,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible customer service. Booked my flight before Covid. Couldn’t go, still can’t go as borders are still closed. I wasn’t given an option just told I have to take a voucher. Now I have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although I booked for a flight for Cayman and I still haven’t been able to go. They cannot provide the service I paid for and refuse to refund me. They are not sympathetic or understanding.  The voucher is valid for another two years, I wonder how many flights will go up by then. I wonder how many more regulations there will be. I’ve been such a good customer and feel I deserve better. "
270,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate. The cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers."
271,"✅ Trip Verified | LCA to LHR in Club Europe. Quick check-in at LCA with speedy passport control and security. Aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink. Boarding by group and pushback on time. CE stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled. Drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows, but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore. Onboard W-Fi was adequate, if rather slow, and it shouldn't be charged for in business class. Arrival ahead of schedule. Disembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly. Overall, a flight that was typical of the post-COVID standard for short-haul business class."
272,"Not Verified |  I had booked a flight from Heathrow on Friday 27th August 2021 to fly to Manchester Airport. On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. I offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister's name but British Airways refused us to board and sent us home. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages. One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me. So ludicrous as I did not take her name and I doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of BA customers a day. "
273,"✅ Trip Verified |  We have flown with BA for many years and never will again where there is an alternative. Booked and paid for Club class flights. Didn't receive a meal or drinks onboard, crew were so unorganised. We were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in-flight service was delayed once up in the air. They commenced the service, albeit very slowly, then abandoned it and closed the service altogether. The crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy.  Complained to BA and received an apology by email with the usual ""we fell short of our standards"" generic speech, but no offer of any partial refund or Avios to compensate for the lack of service. "
274,✅ Trip Verified |  The crew at Denver airport is top notch! So impressed with their customer service. They were very patient and courteous. Thank you all for being amazing.
275,✅ Trip Verified |  An ordinary BA domestic shuttle flight from Belfast to London Heathrow. Usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a UK passenger arrival form from the gov.uk website or risk prosecution. Some people challenged this statement and were rebuked. BA Cabin Crew were adamant that this was now a requirement. But the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice. Some people were anxious departing the aircraft. Other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch. Sky Cafe still not on sale - not quite sure why given COVID protocols in the UK are mainly relaxed now. BA is still by far the best operator from Ulster to England.
276,Not Verified |  I’ve had to book six flights with BA recently. All have either been cancelled or had a significant time change. The latest flight was so late into Heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around 2 hours between flights. BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. They couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. Perhaps BA have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment. It’s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment.
277,✅ Trip Verified |  The service is got super inconsistent on BA and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy. The flight down from London I was in business class I asked for the mini bottle of champagne that I always treat myself to the cabin crew member said I can’t give you the bottle only a glass. However the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out. The crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. We got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malaga. We got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service. Breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 7.50 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach. I have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast.
278,"✅ Trip Verified | Such terrible service in Club World. Such indifference and lackadaisical attitude. Hardly any service. Everything has to be asked for and gotten. Asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say..'whaa' and then when I said cup of tea she said yes...asked if wanted milk and sugar. Brought to me lukewarm tea with 2 sugar sachets, no spoon or stirrer. Pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full 3 mins before someone came by, eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea. Seriously BA...what are you doing? Is this how you welcome back people to fly?"
279,✅ Trip Verified |  LHR to LCA. Galleries Lounge chock-a-block first thing on a Wednesday morning and T5 seemed as bustling as pre-pandemic. Boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full. Superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away. Expanded Club Europe stretching back 12 rows - the new norm? Departure on time. Good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch. Post-COVID lunch remains restricted - Do&Co must be horrified by what they're having to produce: miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish I've ever tasted. Wi-Fi access wasn't free for business class passengers: £4.99 for an hour of intermittent service is excessive. Arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at LCA.
280,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very pleasant flight to Lisbon! It was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at Heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft. However, in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big Club class cabin. Friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers. Late breakfast/brunch served was tasty. What a contrast to the Iberia crew (Lisbon/Madrid/London) who were cold and unprofessional."
281,"✅ Trip Verified | No check in staff for Economy. Never experienced this before. While Business passengers strolled up, Economy passengers were left standing for 90 mins plus."
282,"✅ Trip Verified |  No refund for flights cancelled 14 months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until 30 April 2022. Tickets bought on Edreams on June 16, 2020 for a flight on July 7, 2020, from Geneva to São Paulo through London (British Airways), round trip. The LHR-GRU flight was cancelled without any explanation. I contacted both Edreams and BA a number of times in the last 14 months but they did not refund the 461 Euros that I paid."
283,✅ Trip Verified |  Stranded in the lounge because I wasn't allocated a seat. This for a flight that I booked months ago. I didn't want to use them but was forced to because Emirates wasn't available. I advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options.
284,"✅ Trip Verified |  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York. I am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation. "
285,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from Boston to Heathrow arrived in time, but I and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane. We were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay. Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for. I am very disappointed by this experience."
286,"✅ Trip Verified | Year after year the British Airways (BA) service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming worse. We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. We have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around. "
287,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA used to be my go to carrier and I am a silver member. However their service seems to have gone hugely downhill. Flights get cancelled, the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app, invariably this is not possible. You cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone. If they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly. I was stunned by the recent cancellation to my Catania flight two weeks before I was due to travel. "
288,"✅ Trip Verified |  The entertainment system was working badly, the screen was freezing every time I wanted to open flight map. Though the aircraft was 8 years only, the window blinds worked with delays. The crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a short-haul flight. After flying with Aeroflot and S7 Airlines, I expected to receive an excellent BA service, but I got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water. I think it’s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this. I can get that hot meals on board are now rare. I loved the most comfortable seats in my life! I tend to have problems with sleeping on board, but this time I didn’t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff. "
289,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on British Airways Cheapest Fare which was a Hand Baggage Only fare in Economy Class. Despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23KG each. The value for money here is incredible. The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. There was Wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.
290,✅ Trip Verified |  Very efficient evening bag drop. Security quick. Galleries North lounge was very good. Food and drinks fine. Plane left on time pre ordered door was ok. Early arrival. Fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early!
291,"✅ Trip Verified |  Me and my 1 year 11 months baby girl flew business class from Moscow Domodedovo to London Heathrow on 11 august. When we landed at Heathrow, my baby was sleeping. I asked stewards for my stroller, and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building. I grabbed my sleeping baby, who is nearly 15 kg, and luggage bag (another 15 kg) and walked away. I went and entered the building, and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor. And there was no one to ask. Just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me. On top of that, we landed at terminal 5,and I had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own, holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder. I met no one whom I can ask for a help. First British airways representative I met was after passport control , i explained the situation and he said that I have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases.  No further assistance or help. I had to wait another hour for luggage and pram. I am absolutely frustrated, upset and disappointed! I can see that British Airways do not care about mothers with kids at all."
292,"✅ Trip Verified |  For this flight from Heathrow T5, passengers were piled into the bus and left for 30 mins at the terminal.  Very unhappy passengers - and when confronted the BA transport manager's response was ""sorry - we are still learning"". On arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage (I helped). Shame - since lounge service was very good. For the flight out from Munich BA had not (re) signed up to the now open lounge in Munich. To me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event."
293,"✅ Trip Verified | BA encourage you to download verifly to speed up your check-in, this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff don’t seem to want this, they want to see the actual forms tests etc! This wasted about 40 minutes and is pointless. The return flight again had no access to the club lounge, you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again (last 2 flight not available at NCE but this is more a part of the Covid experience). On board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to Ryanair. On board food was very good for a short haul flight."
294,✅ Trip Verified |  They cancelled a flight I booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof. British Airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher. 
295,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on."
296,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in well organised. No lounge in Cancun. Efficient boarding process. Given water bottle before take off, no welcome drink. Now COVID rules are being relaxed this needs to change. Menu good and food acceptable. Staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience. Managed to sleep a few hours. For the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly. This may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into Gatwick at that time."
297,"✅ Trip Verified |  Departure LGW north so Aspire lounge. Bag from fine, lounge basic, on time departure. Cabin crew welcoming but only given menu, water and amenity pack. Looks like some of White Company bedding options removed. Lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service. Not complete return to old days but getting there. Flight generally good. Early touch down. Club world luggage off last which meant a wait of 75 minutes for luggage!"
298,"Not Verified |  Booked flight six months before travel, then month before the flight BA cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day - bearing in mind that people have work and school that wasn't ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks. We rebooked the flight- as suggested by them and a week later BA cancelled the rebooked flight. We were told that we will receive a refund within 10 working days. Over two weeks passed and I called again. I was informed that they can't give a time frame for processing refunds, and no refund issued yet. BA representative refuses to give contact details to the manager, they cut the phone. "
299,"Not Verified |  The airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover in London, and my only option was to book the next flight that has a 7-8 hours layover. That's before I board the flight to Toronto. While i understand schedule changes, and do my best to stay positive and supportive, i contacted the airline, asking for upgrades to a best seat. I asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport. They denied my ask, no explanations and no empathy. Not only that, but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation. Again, not the change in schedule, not the extra 5 hours layover time. Just the way they chose to treat a customer who didn't do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute. "
